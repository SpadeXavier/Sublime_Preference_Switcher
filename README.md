# Sublime_Preference_Switcher
A script for easily switching between sublime preference files, or between themes and color schemes on Linux.

# How To
Place custom sublime preference files(.sublime-settings) in ~/.config/sublime_preferences. Run this script by typing change_subl_settings in the terminal and the script will search for your custom preference files and change sublime preferences to your chosen file. 

This script also easily allows changing the theme and color scheme of sublime by searching through all packages for usable themes and color schemes and asking which combination of theme and color schemes you would like to use for your preference file. 

Enjoy!
